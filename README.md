# Beltway
A program that finds solutions for the Beltway Reconstruction problem. 
I am currently working on a paper describing the algorithm and looking for further optimizations. 
The program appears to significantly outperform the O(n^n log(n)) backtracking algorithm given by Lemke, Skiena, Smith in 
the 1995 paper "Reconstructing Sets From Interplant Distances". It is also able to provide solutions for sets with greater 
density than those that are solvable by the probabilistic polynomial time algorithm given by Kishore Jaganathan and 
Babak Hassibi (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.2386.pdf).
