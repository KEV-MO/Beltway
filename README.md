# Beltway
A program that finds solutions for the Beltway Reconstruction problem. 
I am currently working on a paper describing the algorithm and looking for further optimizations. 
The program appears to outperform the O(n^n log(n)) backtracking algorithm given by Lemke, Skiena, Smith in 
the 1995 paper "Reconstructing Sets From Interplant Distances".
